## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

#### About Me
My name is Collin Town. I am a software developer from Ontario, and I am still in high school. I started to program in 2012 with the Unity game engine.

#### What I Do?
Right now I participate in FIRST Robotics. I am the lead programmer on FRC 6854. We program our robot using Java, but we also build our website, a PathPlanner in Node.JS and a mobile app using Flutter for scouting. I also participate in sports such as hockey and sailing.

#### Current Project
I am currently working on a mobile app called `Mucy` and is a app focused on mental health awareness. It's a fun little project I am working on during the current pandemic. The app uses Flutter and Firebase technologies to create a seemless experience.
