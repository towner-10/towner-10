#### About Me
My name is Collin Town. I am a software developer from Ontario, and I am still in high school. I started to program in 2011 with the Unity game engine.

#### Previous Projects
I have made an assortment of Unity games and a handful of Unreal Engine games on my spare time. I have participated in 3 years of programming with my schools robotics team. I have experience making apps with Flutter, and have made some tech tests such as my Onboarding Example project where I convert a mockup UI into working software that works on both iOS and Android. I have made a few programs in Node.JS such as a Snow Day Predictor using the Dark Sky Weather API and Express with Socket.IO to create a chat live chat platform to organize get-togethers during snow-days at school either online or IRL. I have made a Game Enginer written in C++ using SDL2 and Box2D for physics, and also using an open-source Lua Interpreter for scripting. I also help maintain [MidiDrumHero](https://github.com/ejj28/mididrumhero) which was written in Python but I helped convert it to Node.JS for a better UI/UX since the older version was cumbersome to use. I assisted in developing the [Regent Granite](https://regentgranite.ca/) website. I completed a few closed-source projects such as: a Minecraft Server status bot, an administration bot, and a music player bot for a private Discord server hosted using AWS. And obviously, like every other developer, there are many other projects I have scrapped because I got borded.
